# Global Suicide Rate Analysis
 
According to WHO 2021 statistics, there are more than 700,000 people suicide each year and 77% of suicides happen in the countries with low or middle income ("Suicide", 2021). Especially among young people whose age are between 15 and 29, suicide is the second main factor to (World Health Organization, 2014). This is a public health problem which negatively affect countries and the whole world. However, suicide is a complex phenomenon. It could be caused by different reasons, e.g., mental health and personal economic status (Bhatia et al., 2006), macro environment, society issues etc. To prevent suicide, one of the most significant steps is to find the reasons behind different groups of people. This report wants to analyze a data on global suicide rate and to find different suicide rate of different group of people, also try to figure out the causes. 

Many countries have realized the problem of suicide and take several actions. From a global survey conducted by IASP and WHO in 2013, 31% of the countries’ government have adopted strategies and plans to prevent suicide (Arensman, 2017). In this report, we also want to compare the suicide result in different countries and their trends.
